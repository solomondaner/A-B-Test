# A/B-Test
In this project I will demonstrate how to properly A/B test and measure the corresponding ROI using statistical significance tests. To provide context, Acme Corp will be used as a fictional company that has a common real world business problem.
## Business Problem
As context, here's a 10,000-foot view of the Acme Corp product:
A consumer posts a request for a service needed. Every request is in some category (e.g., Catering, Personal Training, Interior Design) and some location (e.g., New York, San Francisco).
We match the request up with appropriate service providers and send each of those providers an invite to quote on the request.
Providers view the invite and some choose to send a quote to the consumer expressing interest.

I've just concluded a test of our quote form. After receiving an invite, service providers come to the quote form to view the consumer request and choose whether or not to pay to send a quote. Over the course of a week, I divided invites from about 3000 requests among four new variations of the quote form as well as the baseline form we've been using for the last year. Here are my results:

Baseline: 32 quotes out of 595 viewers
Variation 1: 30 quotes out of 599 viewers
Variation 2: 18 quotes out of 622 viewers
Variation 3: 51 quotes out of 606 viewers
Variation 4: 38 quotes out of 578 viewers

My goal was to determine if certain changes to the design of the form would cause more providers to send a quote after coming to the page. I would also like to know the proper way to design this experiment in order to properly A/B test the different variations.
